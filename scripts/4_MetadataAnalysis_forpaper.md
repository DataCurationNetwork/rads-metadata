# Data Collection Methods

### Data by Affiliation 
Datacite metadata were pulled using the `rdatacite` package in November 2022. Each of the six institutions were searched using the name of each University in the `creators.affiliation.name` metadata field. Results were filtered to include DOIs with a `publicationYear` of 2012 or later, and a `resourceTypeGeneral` of dataset or software. As the search terms returned other institutions with similar names, results were filtered to include DOIs only from the relevant institutional affiliations. 

Following recommendations of the Crossref API, metadata was pulled from the April 2022 Public Release file (http://dx.doi.org/10.13003/83b2gq). DOIs were searched records with a `created-dateparts` year of 2012 or newer, that had a `type` of datasets (Crossref does not have software as an available type), and had an author affiliation with one of the six institutions. 

## Instituional repositories
Upon initial examination of the affiliation data, we realized that our own institutional repositories were not represented in the data because the affiliation metadata field was not completed as part of the DOI generation process. 

To pull data shared in our institutional repositories as a comparison, a second search was performed to retrieve DOIs published by the insitutional repositories at each university. For the insitutional repositories using DataCite to issue DOIs (5 out of the 6 institutions at the time), the datacite API queried by names of the institutional repositories in the `publisher` metadata field. For the one institution using CrossRef to issue DOIs (Duke), the crossref API was used to retrieve all DOIs published using the Duke member prefixes.  

Institutional repository data was then filtered to include only the relevant repositories, datasets and software resource types, and DOIs published in 2012 or later. 

Affiliation data from datacite, affiliation data from cross ref, and the institutional repository data were combined into a single dataset. 




# Analysis

Load required packages and read in combined data. 

```r
#packages
pacman::p_load(dplyr, 
               tidyr, 
               ggplot2, 
               rjson,
               rdatacite,
               cowplot, 
               stringr, 
               knitr, 
               DT)



#Load the combined data from 3_Combined_data.R
load(file="data_rdata_files/Combined_ALL_data.Rdata")

#rename object
all_dois <- combined_dois 

#re-factor group so that datacite appears before cross ref
all_dois$group <- factor(all_dois$group, levels = c("Affiliation - Datacite", "Affiliation - CrossRef", "IR_publisher"))
```

# Collapse DOIs by container 

Some repositories (such as Harvard's Dataverse and Qualitative Data Repository) assign DOIs at the level of the file, rather than the study. Similarly, Zenodo often has many related DOIs for multiple figures within a study. In order to attempt to compare study-to-study counts of data sharing, look at the DOIs collapsed by "container".  

```r
by_container <- 
all_dois %>% 
  filter(!is.na(container_identifier)) %>% 
  group_by(container_identifier, publisher, title, institution) %>% 
  summarize(count=n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(count))
```

How many publishers have container DOIs?

```r
by_container %>% 
  group_by(publisher) %>% 
  summarize(count=n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(count)) %>% 
  datatable
```

```{=html}
<div id="htmlwidget-a404e0c6cfb465bc1b35" style="width:100%;height:auto;" class="datatables html-widget"></div>
<script type="application/json" data-for="htmlwidget-a404e0c6cfb465bc1b35">{"x":{"filter":"none","vertical":false,"data":[["1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8","9","10","11","12","13","14","15","16","17","18","19","20","21"],["Harvard Dataverse","Zenodo","QDR Main Collection","Root","DataverseNO","Johns Hopkins University Data Archive","Portail Data INRAE","Recherche Data Gouv","ACSS Dataverse","Dartmouth Dataverse","Earth System Grid Federation","Qualitative Data Repository","TRR 170-DB","ASU Library Research Data Repository","CaltechDATA","DaRUS","Dryad","G-Node","International Potato Center","Social Sciences and Digital Humanities Archive â€“ SODHA","World Values Survey Association"],[358,110,6,5,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>publisher<\/th>\n      <th>count<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"columnDefs":[{"className":"dt-right","targets":2},{"orderable":false,"targets":0}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
```


Collapsing by container for counts

```r
containerdups <- which(!is.na(all_dois$container_identifier) & duplicated(all_dois$container_identifier))

all_dois_collapsed <- all_dois[-containerdups,]
```

This leaves a total of 165950 cases. 



# Overview of the data

DOI types by resource

```r
all_dois_collapsed %>% 
  group_by(resourceTypeGeneral, group) %>% 
  summarize(count=n()) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = group, 
              values_from = count, 
              values_fill = 0) %>% 
  kable()
```

|Software            |                   4512|                      0|           61|


DOI by institutional affiliation/publisher

```r
all_dois_collapsed %>% 
  group_by(group, institution) %>% 
  summarize(count=n()) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = group,
              values_from = count) %>% 
  kable()
```



|institution   | Affiliation - Datacite| Affiliation - CrossRef| IR_publisher|
|:-------------|----------------------:|----------------------:|------------:|
|Cornell       |                   3921|                    706|          174|
|Duke          |                   2372|                   3603|          225|

## Collapse IRs into a single category

Look at all the Institutional Repositories Captured

```r
IR_pubs <- all_dois_collapsed %>% 
  filter(group == "IR_publisher") %>% 
  group_by(publisher_plus) %>% 
  summarize(count = n()) 

IR_pubs %>% 
  kable(col.names = c("Institutional Repository", "Count"))
```



|Institutional Repository                       | Count|
|:----------------------------------------------|-----:|
|Cornell                                        |   174|
|Duke-Duke Digital Repository                   |    78|
|Duke-Research Data Repository, Duke University |   147|
|Michigan                                       |    10|
|Michigan-Deep Blue                             |   515|
|Michigan-ICPSR/ISR                             |   109|
|Michigan-Other                                 |    11|
|Minnesota                                      |   692|
|Virginia Tech                                  |   333|
|Washington U                                   |    95|

Replace all of these publishers with "Institutional Repository" so that they will be represented in a single bar.

```r
all_dois_collapsed$publisher[which(all_dois_collapsed$publisher_plus %in% unique(IR_pubs$publisher_plus))] <- "Institutional Repository"

#catch the rest of the "Cornell University Library"
all_dois_collapsed$publisher[which(all_dois_collapsed$publisher == "Cornell University Library")] <- "Institutional Repository"

#and stray VT
all_dois_collapsed$publisher[which(all_dois_collapsed$publisher == "University Libraries, Virginia Tech")] <- "Institutional Repository"

#and DRUM
all_dois_collapsed$publisher[which(all_dois_collapsed$publisher == "Data Repository for the University of Minnesota (DRUM)")] <- "Institutional Repository"

##ICPSR is also inconsistent
all_dois_collapsed$publisher[grep("Consortium for Political", all_dois_collapsed$publisher)] <- "ICPSR"
```


## Overall Count of Data and Software DOIs

Think we just keep these together for the main analysis...


```r
by_publisher_collapse <- all_dois_collapsed %>% 
  group_by(publisher, institution) %>% 
  summarize(count=n()) %>% 
  arrange(institution, desc(count))
```

Table of publisher counts

```r
by_publisher_collapse_table <- by_publisher_collapse %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = institution, 
              values_from = count, 
              values_fill = 0) %>% 
  rowwise %>% 
  mutate(Total = sum(c_across(Cornell:`Washington U`))) %>% 
  arrange(desc(Total))

by_publisher_collapse_table %>% 
  datatable
```

# Further collapse by Version

We can also look at the data collapsed by version of a record. This was motivated because some repositories have multiple entries for the different versions of the same dataset/collection. And some entries have many versions. 

Explore versions

Some Repositories attach "vX" to the doi. 

```r
all_dois_collapsed <- all_dois_collapsed %>% 
  mutate(hasversion = grepl("\\.v[[:digit:]]+$", DOI))


all_dois_collapsed %>% 
  filter(hasversion == TRUE) %>% 
  group_by(publisher, hasversion) %>% 
  summarize(count=n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(count)) %>% 
  datatable()
```

How to collapse by version? Maybe that's for another day... 


# Completeness? 


# Write out institutional data

Write out CSV files for each institution: 

* All DOIs
* All DOIs collapsed


```r
for (i in unique(all_dois$institution)) {
  all_dois %>% 
    filter(institution == i) %>% 
    write.csv(file=paste0("data_all_dois/All_dois_", i, gsub("-", "", Sys.Date()), ".csv"), row.names = F)
  
  all_dois_collapsed %>% 
    filter(institution == i) %>% 
    write.csv(file=paste0("data_all_dois/All_dois_collapsed_", i, gsub("-", "", Sys.Date()), ".csv"), row.names = F)
}
```




<!-- ## Overall counts by resource type -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- write.csv(by_publisher_data_table, file="data_summary_data/Counts of Data Publishers By Insitituion.csv", row.names = F) -->

<!-- After reviewing the repositories, we will remove the Faculty Opinions LTD records (these are reviews of articles, no data attached) and the ENCODE Data Coordination Center (extreme outlier for Michigan in 2022, unclear what the level of DOI assignment is) from further analysis.  -->

<!-- ## Software specific DOIs -->

<!-- Subset to only software (only datacite has software) -->
